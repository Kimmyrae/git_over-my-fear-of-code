#THE FINE DARK LINES

we are all just

barely washed hair

and anxiety.

lost socks

and garbage-filled

closets.

pills and

plastic.

pimples and

pot holes.

spider webs

of self loathing

and

piss stains.

procrastination

and prayers.

stop lights and

sirens.

smoke and

sludge.

beautiful

black eyes

and broken eggs.

Just one bad cup of coffee

away from a shoot-out.
